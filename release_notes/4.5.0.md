# Jasmine NPM 4.5.0 Release Notes

This release updates the jasmine-core dependency to 4.5.0. See the
[jasmine-core release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/4.5.0.md)
for more information.


## New Features

* Warn when backslashes are used in paths/globs on Windows 
  * Backslashes behave inconsistently between OSes in the version of glob
  that Jasmine currently uses. The next major version of glob will treat 
  them as escape sequences rather than path separators on all OSes.
  
* Allow instantiated reporters to be provided in the configuration
  * This supports more complex scenarios than the --reporter= CLI flag
  (multiple reporters, reporters that need configuration, reporters
  that aren't default exports, etc) without requiring a switch to programmatic
  usage.
  
## Documentation Improvements

* Fixed default value of Configuration#alwaysListPendingSpecs

## Supported environments

The jasmine NPM package has been tested on Node 12.17-12.22, 14, 16, and 18.
